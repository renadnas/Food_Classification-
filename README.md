# Food_Classification-
computer vision pipeline that classifies food images into 8 distinct categories and provides estimated calorie counts. This project leverages Transfer Learning by using a pre-trained ResNet50 model to extract high-level features, which are then classified using Support Vector Machines (SVM), Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), and Random Forest.
